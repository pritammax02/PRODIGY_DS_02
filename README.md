The Titanic dataset comprises information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic during its maiden voyage in 1912. It contains 12 columns, including 'Survived' (0 for not survived, 1 for survived), 'Pclass' (passenger class), 'Name,' 'Sex,' 'Age,' 'SibSp' (siblings/spouses aboard), 'Parch' (parents/children aboard), 'Ticket' number, 'Fare' paid, 'Cabin' number, and 'Embarked' port. The dataset often contains 891 records. It serves as a classic dataset for data analysis and machine learning, used to explore factors affecting survival and develop predictive models. Variables include both numerical and categorical data. It's employed for tasks like visualization, feature engineering, and teaching data science concepts. Missing values are common, particularly in 'Age' and 'Cabin' columns, necessitating data cleaning.
